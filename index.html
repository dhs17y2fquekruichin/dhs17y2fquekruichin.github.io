	      <h3>Interests</h3>
	      <p class="Stuff">My interests are mostly artistic-based, like writing, reading and drawing. I also like playing music (I'm in my school band)
		      When I've got nothing to do I like to kick back with a book or a pencil in my hand. Playing the piano helps too.</p>
